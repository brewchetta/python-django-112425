# Django Capstone
Today is a project build day. I'm tasking y'all with building a robust project of your choice. I'll be on hand for questions and guidance.

## A Few Asks / Limitations

- Before you start building, make a plan! User stories, model relationships, etc.
- You should build the project in Django
- You should have at least two models you've made as well as the User model
- At least one of your models should associate with the User model
- At least one of your models should have full CRUD
- A User should be able to sign up / log in / log out

## Recommendations

- Add some styling, you can use an LLM like Claude to quickly generate styling if you don't want to spend too much time on it
- Allow for image uploads for one of your models
- Create API routes for your data so it can be fetched from an external source
